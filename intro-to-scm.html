						## Introduction to Source Control

						### Why is Version Control Important?

						As a project grows and becomes more complex we need some way to robustly handle:

						- Versioning
						- Rolling back Changes
						- Collaboration
						- Back-ups

						Note:
						- Versioning: Knowing exactly what's in a particular release
						- Rolling Back Changes: Easily undo mistakes or uneeded changes
						- Collaboration: Most projects don't just have on person working on them
						- Back ups: You really don't want to lose your hard work.

						### Is this Version Control?

						Note:
						- Technically yes. But it's cumbersome and error prone.
						- Difficult to tell what differences there are between two versions.

						### What is Version Control Software

						![git](img/scm/git-logo.png)

						Version Control Software (VCS) is a set of tools for managing changes to a set of files.

						It is used in many software projects to manage source code and is often called Source Code Management (SCM) or Revision Control

						There are many notable examples of Version Control Software however we are going to one of most popular in this workshop - Git.

					<textarea data-template>
						### Advantages of Version Control Software

						- Single source of truth
						- Highly granular change history
						- Easily view differences between versions
						- Tools to aid collaboration

						Note:
						- Show example of each in presentation repository
						- Just the one directory!
						- git log
						- git show
						- Explain the concept of branches but we're not going to cover them today.

						### Let's explore Git

						Note:
						- Show config
						- Create a repository called hacktoberfest
						- Add a README.md with hello world
						- git diff
						- git add
						- git status
						- git diff --staged
						- git commit (Explain how to write a good commit message. Next slide!)

					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Good commit messages

						- Keep commits to a single logical change.
						- 50 character subject in the imperative mood.
						- Think "When applied, this commit will..."
						- Elaborate on the change in a body after a blank line if needed.

						>Remove the speed limiter in time-travel mode

						>A plot device requires the DeLorean to travel at 88 mph in order to activate the Flux Capacitor.
				    The safety speed limiter is disabled when running in time-travel mode in order to fulfil the
				    director's vision. This does not affect cruising mode.

						Note:
						- git log
						- git show

						### Cheatsheet 1

						Download Git & open your terminal

						Set name and email for commit messages

						    git config --global user.name "Daniel J. Rollins"
						    git config --global user.email "daniel@djrollins.com"

						Create a new repository

						    mkdir hacktoberfest-2018
						    cd hacktoberfest-2018
						    git init

						Add a file and add some content

						    echo Hello World! > README.md

						### Publishing Code

						A git repository that only we can work on is not very useful.

						We need to publish our repository somewhere on the Internet so others can download our software and make changes to it.

						But where?

						Note:
						Being able to version and back up our code is great, but VCS become much more useful when you use them as the means to collaborate with others.

						### GitHub

						GitHub is the most popular, free code hosting platform. It allows you to:

						- Browse through millions of software repositories that other people have made, including big companies like Google or Microsoft or the CodeUp Leeds website
						- Upload your own code to share it with others so they can use it and help you improve it

						[github.com](https://github.com )

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Creating a Repository

						You can create unlimited, public git repositories on GitHub.

						You don't need an account to download code made by others, but you will need to to upload your own.

					<textarea data-template>
						### Uploading Our Code to GitHub

						Once we've created a repository on GitHub, we can point our local git repo to it by using its GitHub address.

						    git remote add origin https://github.com/codeupleeds/intro_to_scm.git

						Then we can _push_ our code to it

						    git push --set-upstream origin master

						Note:
						The --set-upstream origin master flag sets the remote repository as the default one when doing an argument-less push.

					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Cheatsheet

						Create a new repo on GitHub. Make sure you leave all in the defaults (except the name!)

						Set origin

						    git remote add origin https://github.com/<repo_url>

						Set origin as our default push target and do a first push onto it

						    git push --set-upstream origin master

						From here on, we can simply write the following to publish our latest changes

						    git push

						Note:
						Exercise: sign up on GitHub, create a new repository (don't initialise it), push local git repo

						### Contributing to existing software projects

						You can download git repositories uploaded by others to GitHub into your computer by cloning them.

						    git clone https://github.com/codeupleeds/codeupleeds.github.io.git

					<textarea data-template>
						### Pulling

						Once you've cloned a repo into a git repository in your computer, you can update your local repo to keep it in sync with the original on GitHub by pulling from it.

						    git pull

						Note:
						Cloning is only ever needed once when downloading a new repo for the first time.

					<textarea data-template>
						### Forking

						On GitHub, you can fork any public repository to create a verbatim copy of it that you own and can freely change.

						If you want to incorporate your changes into the original project, you raise a pull request, which is a request to merge the changes you made in your fork into it.

						- Configure git to to sync your fork with the original repository

						    git remote add upstream https://github.com/codeupleeds/codeupleeds.github.io.git

						- Push your changes up to your fork

						    git push

						- Raise a Pull Request on GitHub to let the original authors know you would like them to add your changes to the original repo (upstream)

						Note:
						_ Pull requests, aka merge requests, are notifications you send to the owners of a repository you forked to ask them to include a change you made in your own fork
						- Merge pull request into CodeUp Leeds website.
