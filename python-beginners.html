						## Python for beginners - Blackjack

						`1nFwoRks!` <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Getting Started

						- Go to https://repl.it/languages/python3
						- You will end up with a screen showing three columns
						- Type in the middle one and click run, the output will show in the right column

					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Variables

						- A way to store something in memory. 'A named box to put something in'
						- Similar to that of most languages, python has a simple variable syntax:
							- Integer variable: `   x = 5`
							- String variable: `   x = "sally"`
						- Variable names are case sensitive
						- Python is dynamically typed - you don't have to declare the type of the variable (Strongly typed languages like Java you do)
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Variables

						Try setting some variables and then 'printing' them to the console using python's `print()` method.
						```python
						x = 1
						print(x)
						```

					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Variables

						You can use operators with variables, give it a go!
						```python
						x = 1
						y = 2
						print(x + y)
						```
						try playing around with strings too!
					</textarea>

					<h2>Lists, Tuples and Dicts</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Lists

						A collection which is ordered and changeable (mutable)
						```python
						mylist = ["pizza", "chicken", "dust"]
						```
						You can access lists with the syntax `mylist[i]` where i is the position of the element.
						List indexes start from 0 though!
						```python
						mylist[0]
						"pizza"
						mylist[1]
						"chicken"
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Lists

						List values can be changed (mutated) like so:
						```python
						mylist = ["bulbasaur", "charmander", "squirtle"]
						mylist[1] = "ditto"
						print(mylist)
						["bulbasaur", "ditto", "squirtle"]
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Have a go at creating a list, accessing elements of it, and changing elements.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Tuples

						- A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable).
						- In python tuples are written with round brackets:
						```python
							thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
						```
						- Values are accessed like for lists - by index
						```python
							thistuple[2]
							"cherry"
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Try changing the value of one of the tuple contents. What do you think will happen?
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Dicts

						- A dictionary, like the prevous two, is a collection of values. However the indexes can be other data types than just integers.
						- The contents of a dict are also unordered and changeable (mutable).
						- In python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and the index together with it's associated value is called a key-value pair.
						```python
							thisdict = {"apple": 0.20, "banana": 0.30, "cherry": 0.05}
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Dicts

						- These are very useful for storing information in a meaningful and organised way, and easily accessing data
						- Values are accessed by their key
						```python
							thisdict["banana"]
							0.30
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Have a go at creating a dictionary, accessing values from it, adding to it, and changing things in it
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Functions

						- Like they sound, used to encapsulate functionality - they do something!
						- In python the syntax is:
						```python
							def function_name():
								# some stuff here
						```
						- Functions can also take 'parameters', things you want the function to do something with:
						```python
							def print_string(string):
								print(string)
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Functions

						If you want a function to do something, and then give you something back, you need to use the `return` statement
						```python
							def add_two_numbers(a, b):
								return a + b
						```
						The return statement will also 'end' the function, so if there was any code after
						the return statement, it would never get executed.
						If there is no return statement, you will get nothing back from the function.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Functions

						Try playing around creating a function that returns something, and doesn't, and see what you get back:
						```python
							def your_function():
								return #something

							print(your_function())
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Loops

						Things with multiple items in them, like lists and tuples, are called iterable - you can iterate over them
						This means you can 'iterate' over every item in the list, and then do something with it!
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Loops

						This is really useful! You can do something with every item in e.g. a list
						```python
							my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
							def square(x):
								return x*x

							for item in my_list:
								print(square(item))
						```

						### TIME 4 BLACKJACK
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section>
						<h5>Blackjack Basics</h5>

						<p style="font-size: 75%; text-align: left">For those that do not know the rules of blackjack (which will be integral to writing this little application!):</p>
						<div style="font-size: 60%; text-align: left">
							<li>You take a shuffled deck of cards and deal 2 to each player</li>
							<li>The card number represents the cards value</li>
							<li>Picture cards (Jack, Queen and King) are all worth 10</li>
							<li>Initially, for the purposes of this exercise, aces are worth 1 point (you can change this later if you fancy the challenge)</li>
							<li>Players can ‘hit’ (add another card to their hand) or ‘stick’ (keep with their current hand)</li>
							<li>The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (going bust)</li>
						  <li>You can continue to gain more cards (by Hitting) until you go bust or stick.</li>
							<li>You will need to have a fake dealer who you play against. (The dealer will play without any user input, making decisions autonomously)</li>
							<li>Closest to 21 wins</li>
						</div>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### First steps...

						- A deck of cards!
						- Need to return a deck of cards that are shuffled
						- There are many ways to do this, but for this example lets define a deck as a function
						- The function should return you the deck when called
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### First steps...

						- Functions in Python being with `def name_of_function():` so an example here would be:
						```python
							def deck():
								# code here
						```
						- You can test this function by printing the deck in the terminal:
						```python
							cards = deck()  # assign deck to a variable first
							print(cards)

							or

							print(deck())  # call and print all in one line
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Tips:

						We will need a way to generate all cards in a deck
						- Loops will probably be very helpful
						- What will you be looping over?
						- How will you store the things you are looping over?
						- How will you store the cards you create?
						- Think about different data types available to you such as integers, strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Tips:

						The deck will need to be shuffled.
						There is something in Python's standard library you can use for this.
						Try googling `random.shuffle()`
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### More advanced:

						- If you have time you can try using ascii symbols to represent the suits... or even ascii art to represent entire cards
						- You could look at alternatives to your regular for loop - check out list comprehensions
						- So you have a never ending supply of cards, you could make it a generator, check these out! (Quite advanced...)
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Example

						```python
						import random
						def deck():
							suit = ['D', 'H', 'S', 'C']
							value = ['A', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K']
							cards = []
							for s in suit:
								for v in value:
									cards.append(s + v)
							random.shuffle(cards)
							return cards
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Creating the deal logic

						- Now that we have a shuffled deck of cards we need to deal them out.
						- The logic for dealing the cards can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it.
						- For now let's make it simple and pass in the deck of cards we've already made and make it return the last element of the list
						- (remember the deck has been shuffled already from the random.shuffle).

					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Tip:

						The method `your_list.pop()` will give you the last element of a list
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Example

						```python
						def deal(cards):
							return cards.pop()
						```
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Scoring the cards

						- Now that we hopefully have two cards as per the original game of blackjack, we need to score them up so we know what score we have for that round
						- Let’s write a function that takes a card and gives you back a value for that card.

					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Tip

						There are lots of ways you can do this.
						Some ideas:
						- Use a dictionary?
						- Use if-else statements?
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						### Example

						```python
						def score(card):
						scores = {
							 'A': 1, '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5,
							 '6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'J': 10,
							 'Q': 10, 'K': 10
							}
						return scores[card[0]]
						current_deck = deck()
						```

						<h3>What to try if you finish all this...</h3>

						<div style="font-size: 75%; text-align: left">
						<li>Add ability for players to decide to hit or stick, and add cards appropriately to their hand.</li>
						<li>Player’s can only add cards until they stick or go bust.</li>
						<li>Currently we don’t include a dealer to play against, include a dealer’s hand and score.</li>
						<li>Declare a winner depending on the score, give appropriate messages - who won, anyone bust etc.</li>
						<li>Be able to have more than 1 player playing against the dealer.</li>
						<li>Handle aces being high or low.</li>
					</div>
